# Plot Gallery

Julia `Plots` provides us with the capability to create visualizations of data.

## Install `Plots` Package

First, `Open` the Julia Terminal (also known as REPL), you can follow the steps [here](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/userguide/runningcode/#The-Julia-REPL-1).

At the Julia prompt in the REPL window, type the following:

```
julia> using Pkg
```

This will tell Julia that you are going to use the package manager.

Then type the following to add `Plots` package:

```
julia> Pkg.add("Plots")
```

## Create Visualization

!!! note

    Keep the REPL open as this is where any output from your program will be printed.

The first piece of code that you need to execute is this:

```
using Plots
```

This tells Julia to load the library that we will use to create our visualizations.

### Example

Let's walkthrough a simple program to understand this:

Write the following code.

```
using Plots
x = 1:10; y = rand(10); # These are the plotting data
plot(x,y, label="my label")
```

Now `Run` this, you can follow the steps [here](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/userguide/runningcode/#Running-code-in-the-Julia-REPL-1).

You will get something like the following graph as a output in a new tab in VS Code:

## Export Visualization

### Save Visualization

You can save plots to disk by clicking on the `Save Plot` button in the plot pane.

![Copy Plot](../images/PlotGallery/SavePlot.png)

The file picker by default opens in the root of the project. You can specify a custom path in `.vscode/settings.json`.

```json
{
  "julia.plots.path": "my_custom_path"
}
```

### Copy Visualization to Clipboard

!!! note

    Due to a current limitation in the [ClipboardItem API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ClipboardItem), plots are copied as png.

In the plot menu, open more actions menu `...`, and click `Julia: Copy Plot`

## Interactivity

### Zooming

Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

!!! note

    To reset zoom double click on the plot.

### Panning

Hover over the plot, grab it and move.
