The code inside a @testitem must be executable by itself, i.e. it can not depend on code that appears outside of the @testitem, unless that code is somehow explicitly imported or included from within the @testitem. There is one exception to this: the code inside the @testitem will run inside a temporary module where using Test and using MYPACKAGENAME was already executed, so anything exported from either the Test module or the package your are developing can be directly used. In the example above this applies to the foo function (presumably defined in the package that is being tested) and the @test macro.\n\n@testitems can appear anywhere in a package. They do not have to be in the test folder, nor do they have to be in a file that is included by test/runtests.jl. In fact, @testitems can even be located inside your regular package code, for example next to the code they are testing. In that case you just need to take a dependency on the TestItems.jl package so that you have access to the @testitem macro. If you have a package MyPackage, then the file src/MyPackage.jl could look like this:\n\nmodule MyPackage\n\nusing TestItems\n\nexport foo\n\nfoo(x) = x\n\n@testitem \"First tests\" begin\n    x = foo(\"bar\")\n\n    @test length(x)==3\n    @test x == \"bar\"\nend\n\nend\n\nIf you don’t like this inline @testitem style, you can also just put @testitem blocks into Julia files in your test folder.","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/testitems/#Running-test-items-inside-VS-Code","page":"Test Item Framework","title":"Running test items inside VS Code","text":"When you open a Julia package inside VS Code and have the Julia extension installed it will constantly (after every keypress!) look for any and all @testitems in your Julia files.
