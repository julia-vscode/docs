To edit your configuration settings, execute the Preferences: Open User Settings command (you can also access it via the menu File->Preferences->Settings), and then make sure your user settings include the julia.executablePath setting. The format of the string should follow your platform specific conventions, and be aware that the backlash \\ is the escape character in JSON, so you need to use \\\\ as the path separator character on Windows.","category":"page"},{"location":"userguide/remote/#Remote-Development-1","page":"Remote Development","title":"Remote Development","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/tasks/#Tasks-1","page":"Tasks","title":"Tasks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/grid/#Data-Grid-1","page":"Data Grid","title":"Data Grid","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/formatter/#Formatting-Code-1","page":"Formatting Code","title":"Formatting Code","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/linter/#Linter-1","page":"Linter","title":"Linter","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#Getting-Started-1","page":"Getting Started","title":"Getting Started","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"release-notes/v0_16/#Julia-VS-Code-extension-v0.16-release-1","page":"Version v0.16","title":"Julia VS Code extension v0.16 release","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"release-notes/v0_16/#","page":"Version v0.16","title":"Version v0.16","text":"Welcome to the v0.16 release of the Julia VS Code extension.","category":"page"},{"location":"release-notes/v0_16/#Inline-evaluation-1","page":"Version v0.16","title":"Inline evaluation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"release-notes/v0_16/#","page":"Version v0.16","title":"Version v0.16","text":"Code evaluation has been overhauled for this release.","category":"page"},{"location":"release-notes/v0_16/#","page":"Version v0.16","title":"Version v0.16","text":"The Julia: Execute * (e.g. Julia: Execute Code And Move, by default accessible with Alt-Enter) commands now asynchronously evaluate the selection, current code block, or file.
